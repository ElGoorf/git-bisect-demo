# `git bisect` Interactive Introduction Tutorial
An intro to my favourite, but apparently not so well known, tool.

First two tutorials are in beta, awaiting feedback from any volunteers :) Please feel free to clone locally and give it a try:

1. Basic introduction: [1-basic-example-draft](https://github.com/ElGoorf/git-bisect-demo/tree/1-basic-example-draft)
2. Automating with test runners: [02-automated-testing-draft-1](https://github.com/ElGoorf/git-bisect-demo/tree/02-automated-testing-draft-1) (requires yarn)
